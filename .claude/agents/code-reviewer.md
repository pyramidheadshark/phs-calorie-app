# Agent: code-reviewer

## Purpose

Reviews code for architectural consistency, adherence to project standards, and correctness. Produces a structured review report with prioritized findings.

## When to Use

Before merging a feature branch. After a major refactor. When onboarding code written outside the standard patterns.

## Review Checklist

### Architecture

- [ ] No business logic in `api/` layer (routers only validate and route)
- [ ] No framework imports (`fastapi`, `sqlalchemy`) in `core/`
- [ ] Services use dependency injection, not direct instantiation
- [ ] All external integrations are behind adapter interfaces in `adapters/`

### Code Quality

- [ ] All functions have type hints — mypy strict passes
- [ ] No bare `except:` clauses — exceptions are specific
- [ ] No TODO comments without linked issue numbers
- [ ] No hardcoded strings where Enum or constant should be used
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks

### Tests

- [ ] Every new public function in `core/` has at least one unit test
- [ ] New API endpoints have integration tests
- [ ] No test adapts to fit existing code (tests define behaviour, code satisfies it)
- [ ] Coverage did not decrease from baseline

### Security

- [ ] No secrets in code or logs
- [ ] User inputs are validated via Pydantic before reaching service layer
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterised statements (no f-string SQL)

### ML-Specific (when applicable)

- [ ] Model artifacts loaded via typed adapter, not raw pickle
- [ ] ONNX preferred over pickle for model serialization
- [ ] Large file paths come from config/env, not hardcoded

## Output Format

```markdown
## Code Review: {branch/PR name}

**Date**: {date}
**Reviewer**: Claude Code

### Critical (must fix before merge)
- [ ] {issue} — `{file}:{line}` — {explanation}

### Major (should fix before merge)
- [ ] {issue} — `{file}:{line}` — {explanation}

### Minor (fix in follow-up)
- [ ] {issue} — `{file}:{line}` — {explanation}

### Approved Patterns (worth noting)
- {good pattern observed}
```

## Instructions for Claude Code

1. Run `uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy src/` first — do not manually flag issues that static analysis already catches
2. Focus review on architectural and logical issues, not style
3. Be specific — cite file and line, not vague observations
4. Distinguish between "this violates our standards" and "this is a different valid approach" — explain which is which
5. If no critical issues found, say so explicitly — do not invent findings to seem thorough
